  <h2>Computer Science Student, Programmer</h2>

  <p>
    Hi, I'm Grzegorz (Gregory), I love to tinker with computers and
    code and value sharing my findings and knowledge with other
    people. I work with Ruby and Javascript the most and if I could I
    would spend my life programming functionally. I like being part of
    agile teams and absolutely adore pair programming.
