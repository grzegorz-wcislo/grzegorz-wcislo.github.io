  <p>
    Hi, I'm Grzegorz (Gregory), I&nbsp;love to tinker with computers
    and code and value sharing my findings and knowledge with other
    people. I&nbsp;work with Ruby and Javascript the most and if
    I&nbsp;could I&nbsp;would spend my life programming
    functionally. I&nbsp;enjoy being part of agile teams and
    absolutely adore pair programming.
